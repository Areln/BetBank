We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.

<h2 style="color:black">Website Visitors</h2style="color:black">
<p style="color:black">Like most website operators, IDontGamble collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. IDontGamble's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how IDontGamble's visitors use its website. From time to time, IDontGamble may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</pstyle="color:black">
<p style="color:black">IDontGamble also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://BetBank.com blog posts. IDontGamble only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<h2 style="color:black">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p style="color:black">Certain visitors to IDontGamble's websites choose to interact with IDontGamble in ways that require IDontGamble to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that IDontGamble gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at http://BetBank.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

<h2 style="color:black">Security</h2>
<p style="color:black">The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2 style="color:black">Advertisements</h2>
<p style="color:black">Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.

We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
